Write a program to implement the following functions on a Binomial heap:
(1) insert(H, k): Inserts a key ‘k’ to Binomial Heap ‘H’. This operation first creates a Binomial Heap with single key ‘k’, then calls union on H and the new Binomial heap.
(2) getMin(H): A simple way to getMin() is to traverse the list of root of Binomial Trees and return the minimum key. 
(3) extractMin(H): This operation also uses union(). We first call getMin() to find the minimum key Binomial Tree, then we remove the node and create a new Binomial Heap by connecting all subtrees of the removed minimum node. Finally we call union() on H and the newly created Binomial Heap.
